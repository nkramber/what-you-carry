# Session handoff archive

Entries older than the 10 newest sessions move here from `docs/session-handoff.md` (D-146). Newest first.

## Session 11: 2026-09-07, Codex

Author: Codex
Session: repeat review of PR #1 after the neutral review-gate change.

### What this session did, and why

- Rechecked PR #1 at effective head `6e45d6f`, including the D-181, D-182, and D-183 changes.
- Confirmed the prior four findings remain fixed.
- Added P1-3 to `docs/reviews/pr-1.md`: PR-1 does not define how `REVIEW_GATE_MODE=advisory` is created.
- Added P1-4: the required review commit changes the handoff path and invalidates its own effective head.

### State of the build

- No solution or implementation exists on the reviewed head.
- The diff check passes. The agent files remain identical. The settings file parses as JSON.
- The review verdict is Changes required.

### In flight

PR #1 needs an owner setup step or bootstrap mechanism for the required review-gate repository variable, and a metadata-path correction for the effective-head rule.

### Traps and gotchas

- D-181 forbids a default for an absent or unknown `REVIEW_GATE_MODE`.
- The PR-1 roadmap says it sets the variable, but the scope contains no repository-state action.
- D-182 and D-183 require the review record and handoff in one commit, but D-179 excludes only `docs/reviews/`.
- The effective head at review start is `6e45d6f`.

### Open questions that block progress

No new owner question. OQ-12 remains open for PR-9.

### Next concrete action

Define the advisory-mode variable setup, correct the metadata-path rule, revise PR #1, and request another repeat review.

## Session 10: 2026-09-07, Claude Code

Author: Claude Code
Session: the neutral grey state for `review-gate`. Branch `docs/roadmaps`, part of PR #1.

### What this session did, and why

- The owner asked where the red check appears, then asked for a neutral grey state instead of a permanent red one. `review-gate` failed whenever no review record existed, so a PR stayed red for most of its life and a red rollup masked a real build failure.
- Verified first that GitHub counts a neutral or skipped conclusion as a success for a required status check. Source: docs.github.com, "About status checks", verified 2026-09-07. A plain grey-when-absent gate would stop blocking a merge at launch. Recorded F-51.
- D-181 gives the check three conclusions and two modes. In `advisory` mode a missing review file is neutral. In `enforced` mode it is a failure. The repository variable `REVIEW_GATE_MODE` selects the mode. An absent or unknown value fails the job and names the variable (T-2).
- A workflow job cannot set a neutral conclusion by its exit code. The job publishes a check run through the Checks API, so the workflow needs `checks: write`.
- D-181 revises D-179. D-180 is not revised, because D-181 only adds the mode step to its launch procedure.
- Marking D-179 as revised made nine citations stale. The D-178 check found each one. They now name D-181.
- Updated the PR-1 scope and exit tests to sixteen, both agent files, the `pr-review` skill with a color table, Phase 5 step 11, and the design register.
- Recorded D-182 after the handoff and review record of sessions 8 and 9 reached this session uncommitted. A later commit absorbed them, and this session then reported the wrong verdict. The `pr-review` skill now requires a commit of the review record with its handoff entry, and the agent files carry the same rule.
- D-182 narrows the scope limit in the skill, which listed a commit as an unauthorized action. A code fix, a merge, and an external message stay unauthorized.
- D-183 lets the reviewer push its own review commit to the PR branch. A push is the only way `review-gate` reads the record, because the gate reads the PR head. The reviewer never pushes to `main`.

### State of the build

- `main` has one commit, `1c16c45`. The branch `docs/roadmaps` holds fifteen commits, all on the remote.
- No code, solution, or CI workflow exists. PR-1 creates them.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are byte-identical.

### In flight

**PR #1 is not ready to merge.** Session 9 approved head `223aae8`. This session pushed `4f7796e` after that approval, and it changes eight files outside `docs/reviews/`, including both agent files, the decision register, and the review skill. The approval does not cover the effective head. Rule 3 of D-179 applies.

### Traps and gotchas

- The verdict in `docs/reviews/pr-1.md` reads `Ready for owner merge`, and it applies to head `223aae8` only. Read the head field, not the verdict alone.
- Grey is correct only in advisory mode. Never use a neutral conclusion for an enforced gate (F-51).
- The `review-gate` job stays green itself. The check run it publishes carries the color, so the Checks list holds two rows.
- Never write a decision range that spans a revised id. D-179 is revised, so a header says `D-176 to D-178, D-180, and D-181`.
- Read the review file before a commit that sweeps it in. This session committed an approval it had not read, and then reported the wrong verdict.
- One session is one handoff entry (D-146). Add a new entry. Do not append to an older one after another provider writes above it.
- A review record that is not committed is invisible to `review-gate`, because the gate reads the PR head (D-182).

### Open questions that block progress

No new owner question. OQ-12 remains open for PR-9.

### Next concrete action

A Codex session reviews the diff from `223aae8` to `4f7796e` and updates `docs/reviews/pr-1.md` to the new effective head. On 2026-09-08 the owner mounts the SSD, and a session runs `docs/runbooks/macos-runner.md`.

## Session 9: 2026-09-07, Codex

Author: Codex
Session: final repeat review of PR #1 on `docs/roadmaps`.

### What this session did, and why

- Rechecked PR #1 at effective head `223aae8`.
- Confirmed the P2-2 fix and reviewed the effective-head command clarification.
- Updated `docs/reviews/pr-1.md` with a Ready for owner merge verdict.

### State of the build

- No solution or implementation exists on the reviewed head.
- The diff check passes. The agent files remain identical. The settings file parses as JSON.
- All four prior findings are fixed. No new finding remains.

### In flight

PR #1 is ready for owner merge. Build and CI checks remain deferred because this PR defines the solution and workflows that PR-1 creates.

### Traps and gotchas

- The reviewed effective head is `223aae8`.
- The review file is machine-read. Keep its head field and verdict exact.
- The owner must still register the runner and move the checkout to the SSD before PR-1.

### Open questions that block progress

No new owner question. OQ-12 remains open for PR-9.

### Next concrete action

The owner can merge PR #1. Then complete the SSD and runner actions before starting PR-1.

## Session 8: 2026-09-07, Codex

Author: Codex
Session: repeat review of PR #1 on `docs/roadmaps`.

### What this session did, and why

- Rechecked PR #1 at effective head `60087b0` against the prior review and the author response.
- Confirmed fixes for P1-1, P1-2, and P2-1.
- Added P2-2 to `docs/reviews/pr-1.md` because the Phase 1 header omits PR-58, D-177, and D-178.

### State of the build

- No solution or implementation exists on the reviewed head.
- The diff check passes. The agent files remain identical. The settings file parses as JSON.
- The review verdict remains Changes required.

### In flight

PR #1 needs a small roadmap header correction. The review record now names head `60087b0`.

### Traps and gotchas

- The effective head is the newest commit outside `docs/reviews/`.
- The old findings stay in the review record with fixed dispositions.
- The Phase 1 sequence includes PR-58, but the roadmap header still states PR-1 to PR-11 only.

### Open questions that block progress

No new owner question. OQ-12 remains open for PR-9.

### Next concrete action

Correct the Phase 1 roadmap header and request a final repeat review against the new effective head.

## Session 7: 2026-09-07, Claude Code

Author: Claude Code
Session: answer the PR #1 review. Branch `docs/roadmaps`, part of PR #1.

### What this session did, and why

- Read `docs/reviews/pr-1.md` and checked each of the three findings against the branch, the registers, and the PR.
- P1-2 and P2-1 have full merit. P1-1 has partial merit. The owner approved every disposition. Recorded D-176 to D-178 and F-47 to F-49. Wrote `docs/reviews/pr-1-response.md`.
- P1-1: T-6 and D-137 prohibit text that names an agent, harness, or model as the source of the work. A tool name that identifies a configured file is not attribution, so the broad reading in the finding would also condemn D-172, D-175, OQ-16, F-15, the PR description, and the settings file path. D-176 states the boundary. The body of the head commit is rewritten, because one clause implied that an agent wrote the commits. PR-1 exit test 6 now scans every subject and body, not only trailers.
- P1-2: PR-11 created the night job and the `night-gate` job together, so the gate had no result to read on its first run, against G-19. D-177 splits them. PR-11 publishes a result record. The new PR-58 adds the gate after one night runs. An absent, stale, cancelled, or failed record fails the gate.
- P2-1: fixed all six stale references. The review named five. A sweep found a sixth at `phase-1-foundations.md:412`. D-178 adds a reference check to the PR-2 checker, so the next revision cannot leak.
- The owner asked for a GitHub merge criterion that blocks a merge without the review files. GitHub returns 403 for branch protection and for rulesets on a private free repository, verified this session. No hard block is possible today.
- Recorded D-179 and D-180 and F-50. PR-1 gains a `review-gate` job. It reads `docs/reviews/pr-<number>.md`, requires the verdict `Ready for owner merge`, and requires the recorded head to be the effective head. The job is advisory until launch. Phase 5 step 11 makes it a required check after the repository becomes public.
- The owner asked for the head to match the PR head. The `pr-review` skill says the opposite: do not require the review file to hold its own hash. The effective head reconciles both. The effective head is the newest commit outside `docs/reviews/`.
- The owner chose not to require the response file. The gate reads the review file only.
- Codex re-reviewed at head `60087b0`. P1-1, P1-2, and P2-1 are marked fixed. One new finding, P2-2, is open: the Phase 1 roadmap header omits PR-58 and the new decisions, and it still says `Correction passes: none yet`.
- P2-2 has full merit. Fixed line 3 and line 9 of the Phase 1 roadmap. Gave `phase-5-early-access.md` the same treatment, because this PR added its sequence step 11. The review did not name that file.
- Ran the regression check that P2-2 specifies. It found three more defects of the same class. The new phase-1 range `D-156 to D-168` swallowed the revised D-158, `phase-2-first-playable.md` had the same defect in `D-157 to D-168`, and phase-1 line 465 cited D-158 with no revision marker. All three are fixed.
- A wider sweep found two older ones: `docs/design.md:28` cited D-136 alone, and `phase-3-full-loop.md:372` cited D-94 alone. Both now name the revising decision.
- Refined D-178. A line passes the reference check when it holds a revision word or when it names the revising decision. Without that clause the check fails on F-34, F-46, and four correct `D-94, D-152` pairs.
- Rewrote `.claude/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md` for the format. It now holds a review file skeleton, the three machine-read fields, a finding format with stable `P<severity>-<n>` ids, the attribution boundary of D-176, the gate rules, a ten-step repeat review procedure, and the response file contract.

### State of the build

- `main` has one commit, `1c16c45`. The branch `docs/roadmaps` holds thirteen commits. The head commit of session 5 was amended, and the branch was force pushed.
- No code, solution, or CI workflow exists. PR-1 creates them.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are byte-identical.

### In flight

PR #1 needs a repeat review by Codex against the new head.

### Traps and gotchas

- The head commit was amended. The review file `docs/reviews/pr-1.md` names head `9459534`, which no longer exists.
- D-176 fixes the attribution reading. Do not strip a tool name that identifies a configured file, a schema, or a version. Strip a claim about the source of the work.
- The owner squash-merges (D-126). GitHub fills the squash body with every commit message. Check that body before the merge.
- PR-58 is new. Phase 1 now ends with PR-11, one scheduled night, PR-58, then the measurements and Gate 1.
- Ids never change. PR-58 sits after PR-11 in the sequence, not after PR-57.
- The PR-2 reference check skips a line that holds `revises`, `revised by`, or `supersedes`. The two F-15 history lines were reworded to hold that word.
- Branch protection and rulesets both return 403 on this repository. Do not plan a hard merge block before launch (D-180).
- `review-gate` reads three exact things: the file name, the `- Head: ` line, and the verdict name. A reworded verdict fails the job.
- The effective head ignores a commit that changes only `docs/reviews/`. A review file commit does not invalidate its own approval.
- `docs/reviews/pr-1.md` now records head `60087b0` and holds four findings. P2-2 is the open one, and this session fixed it.
- A decision range in a header can swallow a revised decision. Write `D-156, D-157, D-159 to D-168`, not `D-156 to D-168`, when D-158 is revised.
- The roadmap header is a scope summary. Update line 3 and line 9 whenever a PR entry, a measurement, or a governing decision changes.
- Never write a decision range that spans a revised id. D-179 is revised, so a header says `D-176 to D-178, D-180, and D-181`.

### Open questions that block progress

No new owner question. OQ-12 remains open for PR-9.

### Next concrete action

A Codex session reviews PR #1 a third time against the new head, per `.claude/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md`. P2-2 is the only finding to confirm. Sessions 8 and 9 did that work.

## Session 6: 2026-09-07, Codex

Author: Codex
Session: review PR #1 on `docs/roadmaps`.

### What this session did, and why

- Read the handoff, agent rules, review skill, STE skill, design, decisions, questions, existing reviews, and focused roadmaps.
- Verified PR #1 at base `1c16c45` and head `9459534`.
- Wrote `docs/reviews/pr-1.md` with three findings and a Changes required verdict.

### State of the build

- No solution or implementation exists on the reviewed head.
- The diff passes `git diff --check`.
- The agent files remain byte-identical. The settings file parses as JSON.

### In flight

PR #1 needs a revision. The review identifies prohibited attribution in a commit body, an undefined first-run path for `night-gate`, and stale references to D-172 and the unresolved OQ-2 state.

### Traps and gotchas

- T-6 applies to commit bodies as well as commit subjects.
- D-175 supersedes D-172. D-173 supersedes D-169.
- PR-11 creates the night result and the gate. The empty-result case needs an explicit contract.

### Open questions that block progress

No new owner question. OQ-12 remains open for PR-9.

### Next concrete action

Revise PR #1, then run a repeat review against the new head. Recheck the commit history, the first night-gate run, and every current-status reference to the revised decisions.

## Session 5: 2026-09-07, Claude Code

Author: Claude Code
Session: fix the attribution setting, no new PR. Branch `docs/roadmaps`, pushed, part of PR #1.

### What this session did, and why

- Found why the Claude Code startup dialog reported that `.claude/settings.json` failed to parse. The file is valid JSON, but `attribution.commit` and `attribution.pr` were booleans. The schema requires strings. When one value fails validation, the harness ignores the whole file, so the co-author trailer stayed on, against T-6.
- Set both fields to the empty string, which hides the attribution (D-175). Verified against the settings reference, the schema in the VS Code extension 2.1.263, and the validator in the CLI 2.1.261.
- Marked D-172 as revised. Updated OQ-16 and F-15. Pushed one commit to `docs/roadmaps`, so PR #1 carries the fix.

### State of the build

- `main` has one commit, `1c16c45`, on the remote. The branch `docs/roadmaps` holds the six commits of session 4 and one commit of this session, all on the remote.
- No code, solution, or CI workflow exists. PR-1 creates them.

### In flight

PR #1 from `docs/roadmaps` to `main` is open and waits for the other provider's review (T-4). The attribution fix is part of it.

### Traps and gotchas

- `attribution.commit` and `attribution.pr` are strings. A boolean makes the harness ignore the whole settings file, and the startup dialog calls it a parse failure.
- A settings file that fails validation loses every setting in it, not only the bad field. Run `/doctor` to see what the harness dropped.
- The traps in the session 4 entry still apply.

### Open questions that block progress

No new question. The session 4 entry lists the open ones.

### Next concrete action

Unchanged from session 4. A Codex session reviews PR #1 per `.claude/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md` and writes `docs/reviews/pr-1.md`. On 2026-09-08 the owner mounts the SSD, and a session runs `docs/runbooks/macos-runner.md`.
## Session 4: 2026-09-07, Claude Code

Author: Claude Code
Session: initial commit, the five focused roadmaps, and PR #1. Branch `docs/roadmaps`, pushed.

### What this session did, and why

- Reset HEAD to `main`, added `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`, and pushed every file to `origin/main` as commit `1c16c45`, message "initial commit" (D-156). The owner asked for a direct push to `main`.
- Created the branch `docs/roadmaps` from `main` for the focused roadmaps (D-156).
- Wrote `docs/roadmaps/phase-1-foundations.md`. Each PR entry has scope, out of scope, exit tests, review focus, a check clause, a gate, and a plain-English paragraph. It adds M-1 and M-2 procedures and a Phase 1 sequence.
- Found two gaps of the audit R-2 class and handled them under D-149. PR-10's gate named a weapon roster that does not exist until Phase 3 (F-38). A test-only definitions file fixes it. The macOS CI leg needs a self-hosted runner that nobody had listed (F-39, OQ-31).
- Added G-21 to the design guardrails: no `System.Random` or wall-clock reads in Core.
- Filed OQ-31 to OQ-42 in `docs/questions.md`: the owner actions and the technical choices that Phase 1 PRs need before they start, each with a recommendation.
- Linked the roadmap from `docs/design.md` section 7.
- Asked the owner OQ-31 to OQ-42 in three batches and recorded D-157 to D-168. The Phase 1 roadmap now cites those decisions instead of the questions.
- Wrote the four later roadmaps in the same format: `phase-2-first-playable.md`, `phase-3-full-loop.md`, `phase-4-content-complete.md`, and `phase-5-early-access.md`. Each has per-PR scope, exit tests, review focus, a check clause, a gate, and a sequence with the owner questions placed before the PR that needs them.
- Filed OQ-43 to OQ-71 for those phases, each with a recommendation. Added F-40 to F-45 to the design register for gaps the roadmaps exposed: wall fade in the mesher, no Deck unit named, no rarity tiers named, no Tier 3 model or budget, no source for the Deck checklist, and no cloud save file set after D-152.
- Pushed every commit on `docs/roadmaps` to the remote after the owner pushed the branch.
- Closed OQ-2 (D-169, .NET 8 LTS, revised the same day to .NET 10 LTS as D-173), OQ-16 (D-172, `.claude/settings.json` with attribution off), and the runner timing (D-171, tomorrow on the SSD). Wrote `docs/runbooks/macos-runner.md`.
- Found that branch protection needs GitHub Pro or a public repository. The owner deferred it until launch (D-170, F-46).
- Renamed the GitHub repository to `nkramber/what-you-carry` and moved the checkout to `/Users/nate/Repos/what-you-carry` (D-174). The runbook cites the new name.

### State of the build

- `main` has one commit, `1c16c45`, on the remote. The branch `docs/roadmaps` holds six commits of this session and is on the remote.
- No code, solution, or CI workflow exists. PR-1 creates them.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are byte-identical.
- The STE checker does not exist until PR-2. This session scanned the changed documents by script.

### In flight

All five roadmaps are on the branch. PR #1 from `docs/roadmaps` to `main` is open and waits for the other provider's review (T-4).

### Traps and gotchas

- The roadmap never restates a decision. It cites D-# ids. Read the `Effect` column before you cite an early decision.
- PR-1 cannot merge until the runner exists (D-157, D-171) and the SSD holds the checkout (D-145). OQ-2 and OQ-16 are closed.
- Nothing on GitHub stops a push to `main` (D-170). The rule in the agent files is the only guard. Never push to `main`.
- The .NET pin is .NET 10 LTS (D-173). D-169 stays in the register as revised.
- The checkout path changed on 2026-09-07 (D-174). Open `/Users/nate/Repos/what-you-carry` in the editor. The session memory for the old path was copied to the new path.
- Each Phase 1 PR has owner questions listed before it in the roadmap sequence. Ask them before the PR starts, not inside it (D-124).
- `Sqrt` in DetMath wraps the IEEE square root. The lint tool must allow `MathF` inside `DetMath.cs` only.
- The night-gate job in PR-11 reads the latest scheduled run. A red night blocks the next merge by design (D-115).

### Open questions that block progress

`docs/questions.md` holds OQ-1 to OQ-71. One stays open for Phase 1: OQ-12 blocks PR-9. One owner action precedes PR-1: the runner registration on 2026-09-08 per the runbook (D-171). The SSD arrives the same day (D-145). Each later roadmap lists its own open questions in its section 6, with the owner's answer placed in the sequence before the PR that needs it.

### Next concrete action

A Codex session reviews PR #1 per `.claude/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md` and writes `docs/reviews/pr-1.md`. The author of this branch is Claude Code, so Claude Code cannot review it. On 2026-09-08 the owner mounts the SSD, and a session runs `docs/runbooks/macos-runner.md` with the volume name. After the owner merges PR #1, PR-1 starts from `phase-1-foundations.md`.

## Session 3: 2026-09-07, Claude Code

Author: Claude Code
Session: audit remediation, no PR. The repository has no commits.

### What this session did, and why

- Assessed the nine findings of `docs/reviews/2026-09-07-repository-audit.md`. All nine have merit. Asked the owner seven questions and recorded D-148 to D-154.
- Wrote `docs/reviews/2026-09-07-repository-audit-response.md` with each disposition.
- Edited `docs/design.md`: header correction (R-8), F-28 to F-37, G-19 and G-20, roadmap entries PR-1, PR-2, PR-3, PR-6, PR-7, PR-9, PR-11, PR-12, PR-16, PR-17, PR-18, PR-22, PR-27, PR-28, PR-30, PR-31, PR-32, PR-49, M-5, a new PR-57, and section 8 rewritten.
- Created `docs/questions.md` as the open questions register (D-144). Section 9 of the design doc now links to it. Added OQ-30.
- Recorded D-144 to D-147 from the owner's message: the questions file, the SSD order, the ten-session handoff rule, and audit-first order. A Codex session added D-155 in parallel.
- Converted this file to the ten-session format (D-146) and created `docs/session-handoff-archive.md`.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and both skills for the questions file, the handoff rule, and the gate clause.

### State of the build

- No code, solution, test project, content, CI workflow, or focused roadmap exists. No commits.
- HEAD points at the unborn branch `docs/repository-audit`. The first commit lands there unless the owner resets HEAD (OQ-30, F-37).
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are byte-identical.
- The STE checker does not exist until PR-2. This session scanned the changed documents by script for semicolons, contractions, verb -ing forms, sentences over 25 words, and passive markers.

### In flight

Nothing is half done. Every audit finding has a decision and a document change.

### Traps and gotchas

- D-152 revises D-94: one profile file plus one run record, not three files. Cite D-152.
- D-150 revises D-136: Gate 1 is a foundation gate with no playtest.
- D-149 moves PR-32 before PR-27 and inserts PR-57 after PR-13. Section 8 is the order. Ids never change.
- The design header keeps the refuted Godot 4.7.1 text with a dated note. Do not delete it.
- The handoff now keeps 10 sessions. Add an entry at the top. Do not rewrite the file.
- The attribution rule stands (T-6). OQ-16 remains open.

### Open questions that block progress

`docs/questions.md` holds OQ-1 to OQ-30. PR-1 depends on OQ-2, OQ-16, OQ-30, and the SSD (D-145, arrives 2026-09-08).

### Next concrete action

The owner said the focused roadmaps begin once the audit findings are addressed (D-147). They are addressed. The next action is `docs/roadmaps/phase-1-foundations.md`: expand PR-1 to PR-11 and M-1 to M-2 with per-PR exit tests, under D-148 and D-149. Load `ste-writing` and `design-doc-style` first. Confirm with the owner that Phase 1 is the first roadmap.
## Session 2: 2026-09-07, Codex

Author: Codex
Session: repository audit, no PR. The local repository has no commits.

### What this session did, and why

- Examined the design, all 143 decisions, the archive, both agent files, and both local skills.
- Wrote `docs/reviews/2026-09-07-repository-audit.md` with nine findings, evidence, recommendations, and verification limits.
- Added OQ-25 to OQ-29 in `docs/design.md` section 9. These cover gates, replay state, save transactions, empty-bank recovery, and economy tests.
- Created the local branch `docs/repository-audit` under D-126. All project files remain untracked.
- Recorded the project skill location as D-155. Both agent files now require `.claude/skills/` for current and new project skills.
- Added direct access instructions for a required skill that is absent from the skill list.
- Added no code. No commit, PR, or merge occurred.

### State of the build

- No code, solution, test project, content, CI workflow, or focused roadmap exists.
- No build or test ran. The repository has nothing executable to check.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are byte-identical. The comparison returned success (D-122).
- The STE checker does not exist until PR-2. The new text received a manual checklist review.
- The previous design interview produced `docs/design.md` v2 and decisions D-1 to D-143.
- The unchanged v1 archive remains at `docs/archive/design-v1-2026-09-06.md`.
- A Git remote URL exists. This session did not verify remote history or backups.

### In flight

The audit and skill location update are complete. New decisions D-144 to D-154 address several audit findings.
The design and agent rules still need the corresponding audit corrections. D-147 requires those corrections before focused roadmaps.

The audit identified four highest-priority findings:

1. The initial PRs require merge checks that PR-2 and PR-3 create later.
2. Several feature gates precede their test tools or game systems.
3. The replay contract omits the initial loadout, skill state, and simulation and content identities.
4. The save contract lacks a shared commit and recovery rule across the three files.

### Traps and gotchas

- The review file records design gaps, not observed runtime defects. No game code exists.
- The five-second rewind in D-97 is an accepted tradeoff, F-17. This audit does not reopen it.
- The Godot 4.7.2 release exists. The design header incorrectly separates stable 4.7.1 from .NET 4.7.2.
- Official links and the verification date appear in the audit. OQ-2 remains open for the .NET version.
- The agent merge gate and the roadmap disagree about the initial checks. OQ-25 records the conflict.
- Section 8 puts palette approval before PR-1. OQ-1 says it blocks PR-14. The owner must settle that scope.
- Keep the attribution rule in every future commit and PR (D-137). OQ-16 remains open.
- The owner owns every open question (D-124). Ask before a choice, and record each answer (D-138).
- Project skills live in `.claude/skills/`. Read their `SKILL.md` files directly when required (D-155).
- Decisions after D-143 revise the audit state. Consult the current decision register before an audit correction.
- D-97 supersedes D-10 and D-95. D-129 and D-132 revise D-120. D-141 keeps decisions in one file until about 300 rows.
- Review ids stay local to the review file. They do not enter the design finding register.

### Open questions that block progress

`docs/design.md` section 9 still contains the audit questions. D-144 moves the register to `docs/questions.md`.
D-148 to D-154 answer several audit issues. Reconcile the register with those decisions before the next owner question.

PR-1 still depends on OQ-2, OQ-16, and the SSD prerequisite in OQ-18. D-145 records the SSD order.
The palette prerequisite has conflicting scopes, as noted above.
D-151 to D-154 resolve OQ-26 to OQ-29. The affected roadmap entries need those contracts before implementation.

### Next concrete action

Continue the audit corrections under D-147. Apply the current decisions before new owner questions.
Keep the two agent files identical (D-122). Check the current register before each new decision id.

The prior sequence remains design v2, then focused roadmaps, then code.
The next planned artifact is `docs/roadmaps/phase-1-foundations.md`.
It needs per-PR exit tests for PR-1 to PR-11 and measurements M-1 to M-2.
Load the local `ste-writing` and `design-doc-style` skills before that work.

## Session 1: 2026-09-07, Claude Code

Author: Claude Code
Session: design interview, no PR. The repository had no commits.

### What this session did, and why

- Read the v1 design document and asked the owner 143 questions in batches. The owner wanted every assumption confirmed before any code.
- Recorded every answer in `docs/decisions.md` as D-1 to D-143.
- Wrote `docs/design.md` v2 from those decisions, in the design-doc-style template and in ASD-STE100.
- Moved the v1 document to `docs/archive/design-v1-2026-09-06.md` unchanged.
- Created `.claude/skills/ste-writing/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/design-doc-style/SKILL.md`, adapted to this project (D-131).
- Created `CLAUDE.md` and the identical `AGENTS.md` (D-122).
- Created the empty folders `docs/reviews/` and `docs/roadmaps/`.

### State of the build

- No code. No solution. No commits. The working tree held only documents, skills, and agent files.
- The STE checker did not exist. The session checked the documents by script.

### Traps and gotchas

- The harness default adds a co-author trailer to commits. T-6 forbids it (OQ-16).
- Every open question belongs to the owner (D-124).
- D-97 supersedes D-10 and D-95. D-129 and D-132 supersede the file layout in D-120.
- The owner named the game "What You Carry" (D-11). The v1 name "Descent" appears only in the archive.
- The design doc uses `M-#` for measurements. The five milestones are the roadmap phases, not `M-#` ids.

### Next concrete action at the time

A focused roadmap for Phase 1. Superseded by session 2, the audit.
